# Why
Abstract problem statements into concrete units of functionality

# When
Early-stage team - no, it's an individual commitment problem
Company is past the existential crisis, and product has achieved PMF - yes
Unreliable timelines - yes
Systemic failure, rather than individual failures - yes


# How

## Metrics
Metrics around execution (DORA metrics)
Reinforcing feedback loops

## Background tasks
Processes as scheduled jobs with minimum cognitive resource utilisation

### Refinement
Estimation

### Planning
Priorities

### Standup
Review

### Retrospective
Review missed estimates as feedback to train the team's estimation model over time

## Monitoring
Monitoring for the execution metrics
- for steady increase in velocity
- for steady decrease in defect rate
- to identify process defects
