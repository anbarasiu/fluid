How do governments create money? What does it mean when the abundance mindset is that the economy will grow so that everybody gets wealthier, and not transfer of wealth from one to the other?

This is a simplified summary of the book ['Where does money come from'](https://www.amazon.in/Where-Does-Money-Come-Ryan-Collins-ebook/dp/B00FFAKEQU), a brilliant book by Josh Ryan-Collins, peppered with my own annotations.

In contrast to the popular mental image that physical money is printed when a government infuses more money into the economy during a recession, it sets off the system in motion, hoping to reinforce the positive feedback loops in favour of growth.

### Where is money created?
The form of money currently in circulation is predominantly digital, and physical currency in the form of notes and coins form a minor percentage. The commercial banks that we all know and maintain deposits in, are the creators of money! How? Banks follow double book-keeping, with deposits being marked as 'liabilities', since the bank owes this money to the depositor and loans as 'assets' since this is money owed by a borrower in the future. Let's follow this with an over simplified example. When person P1 deposits 100INR into bank B1, the bank's now eligible to lend 90INR, if the reserves to be maintained, as per the Central Bank, is 10%. The bank creates a deposit into P1's account and the balance sheet now says [Assets - 90INR, Liabilities - 100INR], with the entire system actually containing 190INR. The bank just created 90INR, which the borrower P2 can spend towards productive activities - say manufacture lamps, hence pay vendors for raw materials and employees, pushing the borrowed money into circulation for consumption. Say the borrower P2 pays a vendor P3, who deposits in his account B2, who's now eligibile to lend 81INR to borrower P4. This cycle goes on until the value diminishes for a single deposit's lifecycle, effectively creating money through circulation.

### How is money creation controlled?
There has to be a central traffic controller, ensuring this money creation system doesn't go out of hand. The Central Banks enforce this through reserve mandates for commercial banks. Bad economy? Central bank reduces interest rates making money cheaper, inducing more supply to nudge towards productivity. Banks can purchase Central Bank reserves at lower cost to maintain reserve requirements, hence having a higher capacity to lend.

But banks lend based on their risk appetite. What if the banks decide to stop lending in case of a bad economical outlook. 

### Case against lowering interest rates
Does lowering interest rates automatically stimulate borrowing by people, or just infuse more supply thereby creating inflation, since the value of money is reduced by abundance? Rather, demand for credit has to result in credit creation, for non-inflationary growth. Credit controls in the Asian hyper-growth countries into the right productive sectors, rather than into speculative sectors, helped achieve the desired nominal GDP growth rates.

### Is credit the wealth creator?
Credit then, is not borrowing from one person to the other, rather it's borrowing from the future, to produce something now, in order to expedite meeting that future. Wealth continues to grow if the future money that's been pulled into the present, is invested into science and tech, or things that propel humanity, instead of getting locked up in speculative or illiquid assets like housing(?).
