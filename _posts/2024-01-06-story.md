Ryan is an agent. He woke up in his usual state of calm bliss watching the sun rays stage a show glistening on air particles streaming in through aqua blue sheer curtains, when resonance (todo: comms mechanism) began and his brain waves started oscillating.

HQ was asking him to prep for his next assignment, which usually involved travelling anywhere across the world. Hopping out of his bed, he got ready for the day and began packing for the trip. He had gone through this many times that he went through the motions of grabbing the different categories of things he’d need for 10 days and stashing them in his luggage.
