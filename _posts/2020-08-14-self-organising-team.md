What could an ideal self-organising team look like?

Ideally an individual would be able to execute independently or contribute significantly in terms of the below.

1.  Technical
    
2.  Managerial
    
3.  Contextual
    

### Technical (How)

-   Understands the problem statement in terms of customer need and could propose an appropriate technical solution.
    
-   Can independently execute and implement the technical solution without a senior guide.
    
-   Can break down the problem into defined units of work.
    
-   Can implement solutions with the quality of code as agreed with peers, and can contribute to evolve the quality in terms of, scaling codebase and engineering pipelines for agility with minimum bugs.
    

### Managerial (When)

-   Can self-manage by estimating timelines for the broken-down units of work and collating it.
    
-   Is committed to agreed timelines and takes ownership to place their work into the hands of the customer (for example, code deployed to production or communication loop with a stakeholder).
    
-   Can identify blockers/potential delays in delivery and flag them to the team.
    

### Contextual (What)

-   Can propose and weigh multiple solutions to a problem statement in order to identify the best approach for the customer segment that we’re serving.
    
-   Can help in scoping the problem to realistic sizes, for each iteration.
    

## Hiring

Define minimum threshold levels, how to identify expected characteristics/potential

## Operating

Focus on creating the right environment for everybody to excel

Create cadences to minimise cognitive overload on processes, rather enable team for deep work and focus on solving customer problems

**Minimise ambiguities**

-   Engineering - scope of problem, solution decided, answer the question ‘Do I have full clarity of how to implement and get to production?’, else ask questions to resolve any unknowns
    
-   Product - timelines (When will it be ready? What exactly is the customer going to get?)
    

### Parameters (Feedback loops)

**Velocity**

-   Measure and improve time taken from requirement planning to delivery on production
    
-   Time to deploy (CI/CD pipelines)
    

**Quality**

-   Code reviews
    
-   Automated test suites
    
-   QA process (manual)
