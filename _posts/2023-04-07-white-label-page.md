title: White-labelled portal (WIP)
description: Hosted white-labelled portal
summary: This is a system I enjoyed architecting, so here is an overview on putting together a simple white-labelled application
tags: engineering, architecture, wildcard subdomain
---

 Perhaps you have an application, say a checkout page, that you would like to white-label, so that your users can fully integrate the application within their own application's experience. The question you would want to ask is, "what are the factors you would want to control and the factors your user would want to control?". Let us set some bounds for the scope of this and let's assume that the application we are building is called Sleepwell, and our users are sleep therapists who each want their own profile page to share with their clients.

# Scope
- Assumes an existing multi-tenant system
- Subdomain (for example, https://user.sleepwell.com)
- Domain can be a custom domain that the user already has (for example, https://user.com)
- User information and branding, which will be the customisable fields

# Modules
Let's break this down into modules.

## Sleepwell application

The Sleepwell application is where the users are registered and can setup the profile page using the settings. Assuming that the user wants a no-code solution that can be up and running in a few minutes, we want to make the experience as friendly as possible. Let's build a user-friendly settings page that allows setting the subdomain, and other branding settings like the fields that can be customised in the page.

### Tenant config mapper

The settings will be fetched and written to the tenant's configuration. Assuming that the data store is a relational SQL database and that a _tenant_ entity already exists, the schema for _tenant\_config_ would look roughly like this

```
id: auto string(256)
tenant_id: fk_reference to tenant entity
domain: string(256)
subdomain: string(256)
other_fields: etc
```
Ensure that the domain and sub-domain fields are indexed, since the lookup would be performed on these fields later.


## Profile page application

![Profile page modules](https://fluid.anbuu.in/assets/images/sleepwell_profileapp.png)

The profile page application has to respond to the configuration settings from the Sleepwell application.

### Host name parser

The host name will be parsed from the URL so that it can be fed to the Tenant Identifier. This will need to handle both the cases of the subdomain as well the domain. Parse only the hostname from the URL as
```
url.hostname //user.sleepwell.com
```

### Tenant identification

Pass the hostname to the Tenant Identifier to fetch the configuration for this tenant. This will perform a lookup on the configuration table by performing
- a first pass match against the domain
- a second pass match against the sub-domain
If either of these match, fetch and return the configuration for this tenant.

### Tenant configuration renderer

Pass the tenant configuration fetched from the Tenant Identifier to the renderer. The renderer will control the customisable fields on the profile page application that will now be populated from the fetched configuration.

## Infrastructure

Now that we have set the stage for what's being delivered to the user, here's where the most interesting part comes in. We have established that we have a multi-tenant system architecture that doesn't require any operational steps for each new user getting onboarded, and can easily scale. We also don't want to manually intervene to setup a subdomain or a domain for each user. We'll assume that AWS is the cloud provider here and we'll leverage AWS Cloudfront's wildcard subdomains capability for this.

### Build artifacts on S3

The build artifacts will be published to a S3 bucket, let's name this `sleepwell-builds`.

### Cloudfront

AWS Cloudfront will be used for configuring the wildcard subdomains and app distribution. A single Cloudfront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket will ensure that the same application is being served for all the subdomains. The application's Tenant Identifier will ensure that the configuration-based rendering is triggered and that the right page is served to the user.

### Route 53
Create a wildcard CNAME record on Route 53.

### Reverse proxy

This step will be required to support the users with their own domains. A user's own domain can be connected to their custom subdomain, via CNAME mapping in their DNS config.
An SSL certificate in _domain.com_, will need to be present in our _subdomain.sleepwell.com_ for handshake, else there will be a certificate error when accessing the profile application.
Server blocks can be manually added in the reverse proxy layer, but we are looking for an elegant solution that can scale without any operational steps. This can be automated with LetsEncrypt & GreenLock(or Caddy or a similar solution).
